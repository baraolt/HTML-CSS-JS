/CSS will first try to apply Tahoma to your paragraphs.
/If the user's computer doesn't have that font, it will try Verdana next, and if that doesn't work,
/it will show a default sans-serif font.

/// Relative text sizing

/The font-size unit em is a relative measure:
/one em is equal to the default font size on whatever screen the user is using.
/That makes it great for smartphone screens, since it doesn't try to tell the smartphone exactly how big to make a font:
/it just says, "Hey, 1em is the font size that you normally use, so 2em is twice as big and 0.5em is half that size!"
